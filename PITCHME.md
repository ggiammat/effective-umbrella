* Resource Management
Automation in resource management (scheduling, reservation, placement, elasticity, dinamicity). Optimal usage of resources. Interoperability among Cloud Providers.

* Monitoring and Accounting
Dealing with heterogeneous monitoring systems in use (models, level of detail, latency, format). Challenges in isolating the usage of shared resources (e.g. energy consumption) in multi-tenant scenarios.

* Quality of software
Ensure, along the software development lifecycle, portability on different platforms and adherence to standards.

* Automatic setup of cloud-based development/testing environments
Achieve the dynamic, on-demand, repeatible provision of confugurable environments for dev, test and benchmark of cloud applications. Benchmarking and characterisation of public clouds.
